### Ingredients

For the tuna salad bowl:
* ½ cup quinoa
* 1 cup water
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 (5 ounces) can albacore tuna in water, drained
* 1 ripe avocado, divided
* 1 tablespoon mayo
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt
* ¼ teaspoon black pepper

### For the dressing:
* 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
* 1 tablespoon miso
* 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* ¼ cup canola oil

### For the vegetables:
* 1 ½ cups green cabbage, shredded
* 2 carrots, grated
* ½ bunch radish, cut into matchsticks
* 3 scallions

### Steps:
1. Make the quinoa and tuna - In a saucepan on medium heat, add quinoa. Continuously stir until it begins to toast and smell nutty, about 5 minutes. Add the water and salt, then bring to a slow simmer. Cover and cook until water is absorbed about 30 minutes. Allow to cool.
2. In a bowl, add tuna, half avocado, mayo, salt, and pepper. Mix, but keep slightly chunky. Set aside.
3. Make the dressing and salad - In a small bowl, whisk mayonnaise, miso, vinegar, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and oil.
4. In a large bowl, add cabbage, carrots, scallions, and radishes. Toss about ¾ of dressing in salad and mix together to combine.
5. To assemble - In a new bowl, add half of the quinoa, half the dressed salad, and tuna salad. 6. Top with slices of half an avocado. Drizzle remaining dressing, and enjoy.
