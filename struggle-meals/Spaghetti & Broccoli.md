### Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
* 1/2 large head of broccoli
* 1/2 pound spaghetti noodles
* 2 tablespoons salt
* 1 red pepper flake packet
* Squeeze of fresh lemon juice
* Equipment: Large pot, saute pan, tongs, cutting board

### Steps
1. In a saute pan over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil, then add all of the smashed garlic cloves.
2. Set a large pot of salted water over high heat and bring to a boil.
3. With a good grip on the broccoli, slice thinly to crumble. Separate the stems and the florets and set them all aside.
4. When the water is boiling, add salt, then add the spaghetti. Set a timer for 1 minute less than the box indicates for al dente.
5. Add the chopped broccoli stems to the garlic oil, then add some pasta water. Simmer for a few minutes.
6. Add cooked pasta to the saute pan, followed by the broccoli florets. Stir vigorously over high heat for a full minute.
7. Add red pepper flakes and a squeeze of lemon juice.
8. Add a little more pasta water until it becomes saucy. Plate and serve.
