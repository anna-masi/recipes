### Ingredients:

 * 3 large sweet potatoes (1 ½ pounds), about 2 inches thick in the middle 
* 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
*  ½ teaspoon ground pepper
* 1 pound ground beef (85% lean)
* 1 large egg
* 1 small onion, grated
* 1 tablespoon yellow mustard
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
* ½ teaspoon black pepper

For garnish:
* Green leaf lettuce 

### Instructions:
1. Make the sliders - Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
2. In the thickest part of the sweet potatoes, cut 1/2 half inch thick rounds. Reserve ends for fries. Cut skinny strips from the reserve ends to resemble fries. 
3. On a baking sheet tray, place discs and fries. Drizzle with oil and reserve some for the burger patties, then season with salt and pepper. Roast for 30 minutes, flipping halfway through. 
4. In a large bowl, add ground beef, onion, mustard, egg, soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Gently combine well but careful not to over mix. 
5. Scoop out about a third of a cup of beef and shape into a patty. In a large cast iron, add reserved oil. When hot add sliders, cook for 3 minutes, flip and place in oven to finish cooking. 
6. To assemble - On a plate, add sweet potato round, top with slider, mayo, and ketchup. Top with another cooked potato round. Serve with the reserved sweet potato fries.
